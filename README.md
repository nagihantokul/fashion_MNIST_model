# 👗 Fashion MNIST Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains a deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset into clothing categories (such as T-shirt, dress, sneaker, etc.).  

The project includes:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** for model training, evaluation, and experiments.
- A **Python app script** for loading the trained model and running predictions.

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── fashionmnist.ipynb     # Notebook: data loading, model building, training & evaluation
├── mnistapp.py            # App script: loads the saved model and makes predictions
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

> Note: The saved model file (e.g., `fashion_mnist_cnn.h5` or similar) should be generated by the notebook and loaded in `mnistapp.py`.

## 🧵 Dataset: Fashion MNIST

The **Fashion MNIST** dataset is a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST digits dataset, but with images of clothing items:

- 70,000 grayscale images
- Each image: 28 × 28 pixels
- 10 classes, such as:
  - T-shirt/top
  - Trouser
  - Pullover
  - Dress
  - Coat
  - Sandal
  - Shirt
  - Sneaker
  - Bag
  - Ankle boot

The dataset is commonly accessed via deep learning frameworks such as **TensorFlow / Keras**.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The core model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, a type of deep learning architecture especially well-suited for image classification.

Typical architecture components:

- **Input layer** for 28×28×1 grayscale images  
- **Convolutional layers** with ReLU activation  
- **MaxPooling layers** to reduce spatial dimensions  
- **Dropout layers** (optional) for regularization  
- **Fully connected (Dense) layers** for classification  
- **Softmax output layer** with 10 units (one for each class)

The model is trained to minimize **categorical cross-entropy** or **sparse categorical cross-entropy**, using an optimizer such as **Adam**.

## 📓 `fashionmnist.ipynb` — Training & Evaluation

The notebook typically includes:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loading Fashion MNIST from Keras or another source.
   - Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Normalizing pixel values (e.g., dividing by 255.0).
   - Reshaping images to (28, 28, 1) for CNN input.
   - One-hot encoding labels (if used).

3. **Model Building**
   - Defining the CNN architecture in Keras or PyTorch.
   - Compiling the model with loss, optimizer, and metrics.

4. **Training**
   - Fitting the model on training data.
   - Monitoring validation accuracy and loss.
   - Using callbacks such as EarlyStopping or ModelCheckpoint (optional).

5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluating performance on the test set.
   - Plotting training/validation accuracy and loss.
   - Generating a confusion matrix and per-class accuracy (optional).

6. **Saving the Model**
   - Saving the trained model to disk (e.g., `fashion_mnist_cnn.h5` or similar).
   - This file is then used by `mnistapp.py`.

## 🖥️ `mnistapp.py` — Inference / Prediction Script

The `mnistapp.py` script is responsible for:

- Loading the **trained CNN model** from disk.
- Preprocessing **new input images** to match training format.
- Running the model to predict the clothing category.
- Displaying the predicted label (and possibly the probability scores).

A typical workflow inside `mnistapp.py`:

1. Load the saved model:
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

   model = load_model("fashion_mnist_cnn.h5")
   ```

2. Load and preprocess an input image:
   - Resize to 28×28
   - Convert to grayscale (if needed)
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Reshape to (1, 28, 28, 1)

3. Run prediction:
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   preds = model.predict(img_array)
   predicted_class = np.argmax(preds, axis=1)[0]
   ```

4. Map class index to human-readable label (e.g., "Sneaker", "Dress", etc.).

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-mnist-cnn.git
cd fashion-mnist-cnn
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt`, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, make sure you install at least:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

### 4️⃣ Train the model (optional if you already have a saved model)

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook fashionmnist.ipynb
```

Run all cells to:

- Train the CNN  
- Evaluate the model  
- Save the trained model file  

### 5️⃣ Run the prediction script

```bash
python mnistapp.py
```

What happens next depends on how `mnistapp.py` is implemented. Common options:

- It may prompt you for a file path to an image.
- It may use a fixed demo image.
- It may be integrated with a simple console UI or GUI.
